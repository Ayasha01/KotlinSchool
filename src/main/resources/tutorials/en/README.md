# Kotlin School

#### Why Kotlin ?
`Kotlin` is a JVM based statically typed programming language developed by Jetbrains.

#### Getting Started
Check out this official guide from jetbrains on [how to setup kotlin compiler & IDE plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)

#### Impress me by code
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Welcome, Kotlin School")
}
```

After successful installation of kotlin compiler start coding to make your hands dirty.
